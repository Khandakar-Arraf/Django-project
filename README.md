# Auto-insurance-fraud-detection
The project has been developed using Machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn. It can detect insurance claim fraud in a web application developed with Django by calculating the percentage of a given claim after submitting a form. The following are the algorithms used to develop the model.:

1) Xgboost - 74%
2) Logistic regression - 73%
3) KNN - 71%
4) Random forest - 60%
